Replace soundcloud.com with soundcloud-og.com for faster SoundCloud embeds ⚡☁️

When you share a `soundcloud.com` link, it embeds a whole inline player. This is nice I guess but when I share a link in Discord it doesn't even work on mobile and half the time it takes so long to load that Discord times out and doesn't expand the URL.

If you are one of the 5 people in the world who share my frustration, now you can replace `soundcloud.com` with `soundcloud-og.com` (or `on.soundcloud-og.com`) and it'll expand with the artist, title, and artwork of a track. No inline player but I don't need it anyway and at least it will load fast & 100% of the time!
